        outside investment funding, and Brioche is only made possible by contributors
        and developers like you. If you are interested in <strong

        >, <strong>build tooling</strong>, <strong>development tools</strong>,
        or working on <strong>Rust</strong> or <strong>TypeScript</strong> projects,

          cloud costs and for self-hosted hardware. I'd also love to work on
          Brioche full-time one day, or even bring on other full-time
          developers!</p
